# SpacecraftOrbit
A few simple routines for visualizing or otherwise analyzing the orbits of and observations by spacecraft.
Right now, this includes a super simple notebook to plot the orbit of a spacecraft (using Juno as an example), 
including plotting observations taken along that orbit, and including plotting the orbit as seen from the 
reference frame of J2000 as well as the reference frame of Jupiter. The observation times are collected from PDS 
data and for this notebook only include JunoCam observations.
