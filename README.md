# SpacecraftOrbit
A few simple routines for visualizing or otherwise analyzing the orbits of and observations by spacecraft.
Right now, this includes a super simple notebook to plot the orbit of a spacecraft (using Juno as an example), 
including plotting observations taken along that orbit. The observation times are collected from PDS data and for this notebook 
only include JunoCam observations.
